# About the project:

___"Crazy Animals"___ is my pet project. Itâ€™s a platform game with one level. In this game I emphasized interaction with physics and level design.
  
___Core mechanics:___ the player controls a capsule that can fly on a rope, shoot enemies and collect loot, the hero also has a couple of abilities that he can use, like as time dilation.

>___Interactions___ were created using physics. Also in the game there is a nice UI. All the effects of the game were created using the partiicle system
